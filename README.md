# markov-chains
Fun application of Markov chains with text.

##Example
```ruby
MarkovChain.generate("trump_inauguration.txt", 100)
=> "chief justice roberts president obama and no longer everyone watching all bleed the same glorious freedoms and their gracious aid throughout this transition they celebrated in every hall of our jobs left and reasonable demands of so with the rewards of our borders we will never be done every hall of nebraska they celebrated in every breath of dollars overseas while americas infrastructure has been your country their pain their dreams and we will no room for their children trapped in our government is when you now you the wealth of our inner cities rustedout factories scattered like tombstones across"


MarkovChain.generate("buckminsterfullerene.txt", 300) 
=> "buckminsterfullerene or bucky-ball is still immature and a geodesic domes buckminsterfullerene is one of c cage and titanium the name is one of c fluorine and chlorine usually synthesized this way that can be found in cbr the fullerene molecule with a c cage and a vast number of fluorine atoms are usually synthesized this way that can be useful for a reference to nucleus to have been detected in small molecules such as c framework into a vertex with extraordinary selectivity on the study of a result the atoms have been shown to each other under various conditions a way endohedral fullerenes are shorter than the vertices of each polygon edge it can be detected in the br add to c framework into a -addition while cl and are produced some with a vertex with respect to remote c can be encapsulated inside the formula c framework into a bond along each polygon edge the discovery led to steric factors for a football soccer ball made of c as the study of a drum-shaped molecule is a flattening of endohedral fullerenes buckminsterfullerene or molecule with respect to remote c cage and its discovery led to exert an inhibition on the allotrope named the metal atoms or molecules and are in chemistry for a vast number of the atoms in donoracceptor based solar spectrum in the nucleus diameter of c were awarded the three isoforms of each polygon and intriguing chemical tracers in the name is a way that can be considered double bonds between a carbon atom at rice university kroto james r heath sean obrien robert curl and closing the structure is one or -positions with a way that c-based films could be used in the largest objects to perform circular motions inside the noted futurist and cbr"
